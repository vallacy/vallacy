### Hi!

I'm Valerie Ryan. I have a PhD in Behavioral Science (aka Research Psychology) and a master's degree in Statistics.

I mostly use R in my quantitative work, but am familiar with SAS and have dabbled in SQL. I've also used SPSS, but I don't recommend it. 😂 I use Dedoose for personal qualitative or mixed-methods research projects and I use Q-Notes for qualitative projects at work.


- 🔭 I’m currently learning some Python basics
- 📊 Analyses I use most frequently: network analysis (ERGMs), generalized linear model (GLM), factor analysis
- 🎓 My dissertation was about men involved in primary prevention of domestic violence
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a pet rabbit named Bill Nye the science bun 🐇
