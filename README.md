### Hi!

I'm Valerie Ryan. I have a PhD in Behavioral Science (aka Research Psychology) and a master's degree in Statistics.

I mostly use R in my quantitative work, but I am also familiar with SAS and have dabbled in SQL. Right now I am (slowly) learning Python. I've also used SPSS, but I don't recommend it. 😂 I use Dedoose for personal qualitative or mixed-methods research projects and I use Q-Notes for qualitative projects at work.

My personal work utilizes feminist theories; my dissertation was about men involved in primary prevention of domestic violence.
