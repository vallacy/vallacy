### Hi!

I'm Valerie Ryan. I have a PhD in Behavioral Science (aka Research Psychology) and a master's degree in Statistics. I just starting working at NCHS!

I mostly use R in my quantitative work, but I am also familiar with SAS and SQL. Right now I am learning Python. I've also used SPSS, but I don't recommend it. 😂 I use Dedoose for qualitative and mixed-methods research.

Most of my work utilizes feminist theories and my dissertation focused on men involved in primary prevention of domestic violence.
