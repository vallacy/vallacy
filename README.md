### Hi!

I'm Valerie Ryan. I have a PhD in Behavioral Science (aka Research Psychology) and a master's degree in Statistics.

I mostly use R in my quantitative work, but am familiar with SAS and have dabbled in Python and SQL. I use [Q-Notes](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/qnotes/About.aspx) for qualitative projects at work.
